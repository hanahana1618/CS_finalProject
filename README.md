#WildFire
Repository for final project of CS class.

Everyone has a specific branch with their name on it. You will work on such a branch until we decide to merge all of them. Master branch shall not be worked on.

Learn as much ASP.Net core as you can, using Visual Studio's MVC setup we will be creating the site.

The database and model management will be done by Kitty and me. I will work on the database logic and Kitty on the model management and SQL queries.

Controllers and class defaults will be written by Renel and Jeffrey, you guys decide how you want to implement it. 

Chaz will work on the aesthetics of the site, just plan how it will look like. Writing whatever you think works in a piece of paper and deciding the color scheme is fine for now. Just know what you are going to be creating.

If we do decide to implement APIs to collect data or otherwise, I will write in in Python 2.7.

By Saturday at 10 am you don't need to have anything done, per se, but we all need to be ready to start coding after a couple of hours of general planning.
