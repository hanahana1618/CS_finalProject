#WildFire
Repository for final project of my CS class.

Everyone has a specific branch with their name on it. You will work on such a branch until we decide to merge all of them. Master branch shall not be worked on.

Learn as much ASP.Net core as you can, using Visual Studio's MVC setup we will be creating the site. Having already looked at some APIs that maybe useful to implement we are now creating index pages from our respective branches.
